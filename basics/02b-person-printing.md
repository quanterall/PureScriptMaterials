# Example of handling union types & record types together

What follows is the full example of the union & record example in the document on
[Composite Datatypes](./02-composite-datatypes.md). Try creating a project with
`stack new people quanterall/basic` and putting the code in the `Library.hs` file:

It can also be very instructive to modify and add more information to see how it affects compilation
and the running of the program. As an example, you could try adding more professions as well as imbue
the `Dead` case of `Age` with either a year of death or the age someone died at.

```haskell
import Prelude

data Person = Person
  { personName :: String,
    personAge :: Age,
    personProfession :: Profession
  }

-- These are here only to distinguish "normal strings" from these particular types of strings.
-- `newtype` doesn't actually create a new type for runtime, but exists only as a distinction
-- between the types for compile-time.
newtype CompanyName = CompanyName String
newtype FictionalWorkName = FictionalWorkName String

data Age
  = Dead
  | Living Int

-- Our union cases can care about wildly different things.
data Profession
  = Programmer ProgrammerRole CompanyName
  | Professor Subject
  | Student Subject
  | FictionalCharacter FictionalCharacter
  | Unemployed

data ProgrammerRole
  = Backend
  | Frontend
  | Fullstack

data Subject
  = Finance
  | Physics AppliedOrTheoretical
  | Mathematics AppliedOrTheoretical
  | ComputerScience
  | ComputerEngineering

data AppliedOrTheoretical = Applied | Theoretical
